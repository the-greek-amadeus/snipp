            <div class="text">
              <p>The main reason for most mental illnesses to increase is because no one talks about them. Even though in the past it was always suggested that one should keep everything to themselves so that people do not make fun of their feelings and thoughts. Now the same seems like a compulsion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text order-1">
              <p>Now that’s something that every other person says but, in our country, in India no one wants to take mental health seriously. There is a lot of stigma (when someone sees you in a negative way because of your mental illness) and discrimination. No one treats mental illness the way they treat a physical illness. For them being healthy is only physical health, whereas in reality health is when both your physical body and mental state are in harmony. Unfortunately, People are still casually termed “paagal” (mad) when associated with depression, even by educated people. In fact, Bollywood recently came out with a film titled, “Mental Hai Kya”, which was changed to “Judgemental Hai Kya” after a big commotion.</p>

              <div class="text">
                <p>This clearly shows the way people in India think. This is probably the reason why India is shortlisted amongst the countries with the maximum number of depressed people. Most people have mental health issues due to their work life. In cases like depression people do not understand the intensity of the illness. They either think that the person having depression is needy or is ungrateful, but maybe sometimes they just need someone to talk to and lean on. Its ok to talk to others but it's necessary to listen to others who are talking to you about their mental illness, because it took them a lot to come and speak to you. The least one can do is NEVER JUDGE.</p>

            <p>Here’s a story of our friend who was recently diagnosed with OCD (Obsessive-compulsive disorder)
              <br>
              <br>
              Sanjana was diagnosed with OCD. She had many obsessions, including ones related to contamination (fear of contracting HIV), aggressions (intrusive image of hitting someone) and symmetry (exactness in the level of water).
              <br>
              <br>
              “People don't know what it's like; they often loosely term the illness thinking it is no big deal. Whereas, in reality they don't know what it's like. It’s so hard to go out and touch anything; from groceries to using the metro, it's all like a quest. On top of that I have people making fun of how obsessive I get with something or the kind of anxiety I face because of my illness. I wish someone would just try to understand what I am going through.”</p>
